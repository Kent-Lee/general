The front-end of Generals is built with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript. Preliminary action validation for error messages and fair gameplay are also handled in the front-end. Unit sprites are represented as HTML5 canvas elements, allowing their stats to be arbitarily set by the game admin while maintaining a small overall package size.
The back-end is built on WebSockets, ExpressJS, PostgresSQL, and NodeJS. Generals required realtime, asyncronous communication between the server and clients to handle both game and chat functionality, which made WebSockets the obvious choice. WebSocket messages are emitted for each player movement and chat message. All incoming action messages are validated server-side before being emitted to other clients, ensuring fair gameplay.
Game rooms, including their chat logs and board states are recorded in a PostgresSQL database handled by ExpressJS.
